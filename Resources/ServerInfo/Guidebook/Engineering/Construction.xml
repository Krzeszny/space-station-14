  The [color=cyan]construction menu[/color] is how you build and craft objects in the game.
  It can be accessed by pressing [color=yellow][bold][keybind="OpenCraftingMenu"][/bold][/color] or by clicking its button on the interface.

  ### Grid Placement
  When placing objects that "snap" to the grid, hold [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorLinePlace"][/bold][/color] to place an entire [color=cyan]line[/color] at a time, and [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorGridPlace"][/bold][/color] to place an entire [color=cyan]grid[/color] at a time.

  ### Ingredients
  When crafting objects with a lot of ingredients, keep in mind you don't have to hold everything at once; you can simply place the ingredients on the floor, in your backpack or on a table near you, and they'll be used up during crafting like normal.

  ### Rotating
  

  ### Flipping
  Some objects are flippable, such as Gas Mixers and Filters.
  [color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorRotateObject"][/bold][/color] rotates construction ghosts clockwise.
  \n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="EditorFlipObject"][/bold][/color] flips them.

  ### In-world Building
  [color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateObjectClockwise"][/bold][/color] rotates unanchored (unwrenched) objects clockwise.
  \n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="RotateObjectCounterclockwise"][/bold][/color] rotates them counterclockwise.
  \n[color=yellow][bold][keybind="FlipObject"][/bold][/color] flips them.
